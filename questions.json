Vital signs: BP 158/94 mmHg, HR 112 bpm, RR 24/min, SpO2 92% on room air. ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Patient is diaphoretic and anxious.",

            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "While all actions are important, obtaining a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes of arrival is critical for STEMI diagnosis per AHA guidelines. Oxygen should only be administered if SpO2 <90% to avoid hyperoxygenation risks. Nitroglycerin requires blood pressure monitoring first. Therapeutic hypothermia isn't indicated until after ROSC in cardiac arrest.",
